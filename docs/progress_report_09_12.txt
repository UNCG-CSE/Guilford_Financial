Introduction:

	For our final project data set, we have chosen the Guilford County financial reports. Our goals for this project will be to try to discover any trends within the data regarding the county budget, mainly focusing on anomalies in the data and to try to develop a model for financial projections. In the future we may divide these goals to be on a per department basis.
	To accomplish these goals we plan to build a data dictionary and a database for compiling all of our data.
