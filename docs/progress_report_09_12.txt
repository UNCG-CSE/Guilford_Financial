Introduction:

	For our final project data set, we have chosen the Guilford County financial reports. 
  We have data for Guilford county approved budgets from 2013-2018 and transactions from 2007-2018. 
  Our goals for this project will be to try to discover any trends within the data regarding the county budget, 
  mainly focusing on anomalies in the data and to try to develop a model for financial projections. In the future 
  we may divide these goals to be on a per department basis. To accomplish these goals we plan to build a data 
  dictionary and a database for compiling all of our data. 
  Using the models we derive from this data, the county should be able to more easily plan their budgets for upcoming years.
	In addition, they should be able to use our python modules to find anomalies in future data sets.
