# Budget
* Hierarchy: Fund, dept, sub-dept, service
* Service # - accounting unit to identify a sub-program of a larger program
* Account # - starts with 5 = expense, starts with 4 = revenue
* ExpSort - Expenditure sort, disregard
* If AU-All is zero, then it wasn't active
* Per-capita - amount per person, 50812 -> population in 2013, July of fiscal year
    * source: NC office of OMB
* If amount is missing, then is zero
* Budgets are allocated July 1
* Stick to 100 & 200 fund #s
    * 499 is fire

# Transactions
* There could be multiple payments which look the same, but are indeed
    different
* Never reverse signs on expenses
* Transactions won't necessarily equal to budget
