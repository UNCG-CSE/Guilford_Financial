Anomaly Detection -

As far as we can tell, there is not enough data to be able to predict 
future budgets in a useful way that allows for anomaly detection. 
Because prices fluctuate over time, without the price data for the budget, 
it would be difficult to accurately predict anything.

Budget Forecasting using Time series for average spending in a month (Machine Learning) - 

Time Series (TS) is a collection of data points collected at constant time intervals. 
These are analyzed to determine the long term trend so as to forecast 
the future or perform some other form of analysis. 
But what makes a TS different from say a regular regression problem? 
There are 2 things: It is time dependent. 
So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesnâ€™t hold in this case. 
Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most TS have some form of seasonality trends, 
i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame. 
For example, if you see the sales of a woolen jacket over time, you will invariably find higher sales in winter seasons.

For this: First step is to Check Stationarity of a Time Series 
Second step is to make it Stationarity if it is not. 
Third use a machine learning model to predict time series.
