Task: Transaction Regression - Greg
      Question: Can we predict/estimate a transaction amount?
      Method: Plot transaction data to see if there seems to be any trend.
      Outcomes: Single variable linear regression is not enough. 
                Plotting by account number or date shows no relation.
                Multiple linear regression by account number and date shows no relation.
      Implications: Regression likely won't be effective for dealing with the transaction data. 
      
Task: Anomaly Detection - Cody
      Question: Can we find budgets that are above/below the expected range of budget values?
      Method: Sig3 analysis on budget data, divided into revenue and expense data sets.
              Any value more than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean is considered an anomaly.
      Outcomes: Plotted anomalies observed per department over the 5 year period. 
      Implications: We have the ability to find anomalous budget amounts.
