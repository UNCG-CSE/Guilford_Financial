Task: Transaction Regression - Greg
      Question: Can we predict/estimate a transaction amount?
      Method: Plot transaction data to see if there seems to be any trend.
      Outcomes: Single variable linear regression is not enough. 
                Plotting by account number or date shows no relation.
                Multiple linear regression by account number and date shows no relation.
      Implications: Regression likely won't be effective for dealing with the transaction data.
