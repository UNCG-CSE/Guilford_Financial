Introduction:
Guilford County Financial Modeling is the idea for our project. We have data for Guilford County approved budgets from 2013-2018 and transactions from 2007-2018.
The dataset available is financial data mainly including adopted/amended budget data and historical transaction
data for the Guilford County. The idea is to help the Financial and Budget Department
of Guilford County in maintaining their expected spending and transactions.

Our goals are to be able to discover anomalies in the given financial data and be able to discover new
anomalies as new data is added. Eventually, we would also like to be able to
make financial forecasts and predictions based on the given data. We would like to be able to make predictions about
upcoming transactions. If time allows, we would also like to be able to implement a method for predicting what transactions are likely to
happen in the future. In the interest of keeping our project to a reasonable scope, we are focusing on anomaly detection. Our goal
at this point is to develop a method for discovering anomalies in the past financial data and for catching new anomalies as new data comes in.

In order to achieve these goals efficiently, we have divided the tasks among our team
members like maintaining the data dictionary and documentation, finding the relationships
in the data, finding the patterns in data in different departments, how the spending
trends change with time, detecting anomalies or abnormalities in transactions
and/or total actual spending as we move through the year.
